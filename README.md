# Neural-network-ophtalmology
Neural network that determines the presence of astigmatism on the keratopogram of the eye

- To check the network you only need the folder 'check network'. Run the file "Network_check.ipynb" (or .py). Then choose the image from 'Images for testing final network'. Done! You can see the result: Astigmatism or not.

- To train the network run the file 'Network_training.ipynb'. It will save the best parameters in 'final_network_params'. If you want then check it, copy that instead old version in 'check' folder. Done!
